    "There are two types of random number generator: (1) True Random Number generators, and (2) Psuedo Random Number generators. \n",
    "The Numpy.Random package is a Pseudo random number generator. Pseudo Random number generators differ from True random number generators in that the numbers are not really random. They are based on algorithm (the Mersenne Twister in Python's case) that selects numbers that seem random, but in reality can be reproduced or predicted if you manage to see what is happening \"under the hood\". This is what makes pseudo random number unreliable for security purposes such as encryption or generating passwords. True random number generators are impossible to predict (or close enough). One example of a True Random Number generator would be rolling a dice and seeing what you get. This would be pretty labourious for commercial application, so people have created several methods for getting true random numbers such as RANDOM.ORG which uses atmospheric noise or others that use quantum phenoena. As true random number generators can only produce a limited number of random numbers per second, they are often used to create the seed for a faster pseudorandom number generator. Python does have a seperate package for generating cryptographically strong random numbers, which is called Secrets."
